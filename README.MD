## WackyModer's custom kernels

These are WackyModer's (my) kernels.

uhh theres no license... use them how you'd like.

**All of these work, your computer might not be banger enough**

These should only be able to work without issue on linux. I do not care about windows or mac builds.

I tolerate criticism. 

### Also setup lol

I use Ubuntu, I don't know how to do this on any other distro

install the things:

```
sudo apt install qemu
sudo apt install gcc
sudo apt install make
```

```
make all
that does the thing where it compiels

make emu
that launches the emulator

sudo make flash
flashes it to the drive, WATCH OUT
I do not check which drive so... :3

make both
it compiles and then emulates.
```

thats it.

bye :3
