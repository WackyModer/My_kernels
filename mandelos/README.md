## I generate the mandelbrot set.

### Controls:

```
1: decrease iterations
2: increase iterations
wasd: up-left-down-right
e: zoom in
q: zoom out
t: b/w mode (slightly faster)
y: colored mode (slightly slower)
```

This does not work on ***ALL*** real hardware, as it uses an unofficial video mode extention. (It works for me and I have a gtx 1070/80 (too lazy to check which one))

Your mileage may vary, I'm implementing a video mode picker.
